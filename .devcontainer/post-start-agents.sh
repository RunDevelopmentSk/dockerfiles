# WORKAROUND (temporary, see docs/ai-agents.md and .devcontainer/agents.md):
# `auggie` (Auggie CLI) silently finds zero rules through the symlink `.augment/rules ->
# ../.agents/rules` - it appears to resolve directory entries by their raw (non-dereferenced)
# type, under which a symlinked directory looks like neither a file nor a directory, so it gets
# silently skipped. A real, non-symlinked directory in the same location is read correctly.
#
# Until this is fixed upstream, materialize the symlink into a real directory containing a fresh
# copy of the source `.md` files on every container start. The materialize flag below (true/1 to
# materialize, false/0 to keep/restore the plain symlink instead) makes this easy to toggle.
