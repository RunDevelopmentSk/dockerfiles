description: >-
  Review changes made by an AI agent - either currently staged files, specific
  commit(s), or branch changes against main - and report remarks only (read-only,
  no edits/commits). For source code, reviews against architectural and
  language/framework-specific quality criteria for the identified type (proper
  code review); for non-code changes (docs, config, data, prompts, ...), evaluates
  correctness and completeness against the original user request/prompt. Asks for
  the change source (staged vs commit hash(es) vs branch) and the original request
  if not already given. Use for "review changes", "changes review", "revise AI agent
  changes", "review staged files", "review commit <hash>", "review branch changes",
  "review branch", "PR review".

# run-review-changes

Skill for reviewing/revising a set of changes that an AI agent already made - **a read-only
review**: the agent only writes remarks, and never edits, stages, unstages, or commits
anything.

## When to use

- "review changes", "changes review", "revise the changes", "review staged files", "review commit `<hash>`", "review branch changes against main", "review branch", "PR review", "review PR",
- the entry point is also the command `/run.review-changes`.

## Input

Two things must be known before the review starts. If the user already specified them in the
request, do not ask again - otherwise ask now (can be combined into a single question):

1. **Source of changes** - one of:
   - **staged files** (`git diff --cached`),
   - **commit hash(es)** to review (single hash, a range, or a list of discrete hashes), or
   - **branch changes** against another branch (usually `main`, using `git diff main...` or `git diff main...HEAD`).
2. **Original request/prompt** that led to the changes (the instruction that was given to the
   AI agent whose output is being reviewed) - needed to judge correctness of non-code changes
   and the completeness of the whole change set.

## 1. Determine the diff to review

- **Staged files**: `git status --porcelain` (staged entries) + `git diff --cached` for the
  full content diff; `git diff --cached --stat` for a quick file overview.
- **Commit hash(es)**:
  - single hash -> `git show <hash>`,
  - contiguous range -> `git diff <hash1>^..<hash2>` (or `git log --oneline <hash1>..<hash2>` +
    per-commit `git show`),
  - discrete/non-contiguous list -> review each commit separately with `git show <hash>` and
    report findings per commit,
  - if it is unclear whether the given hashes form a range or a discrete list, ask the user.
- **Branch changes** (Pull Request code review):
  - branch changes against `main` (or another target branch if specified) -> `git diff main...HEAD` (or `git diff main...` or specifying another base like `git diff target_branch...HEAD`) to view all changes introduced in the current branch since it branched from `main`.
  - `git log main..HEAD --oneline` to see the commits included in the review.
- Never modify the working tree/index while inspecting the diff (no `git add`, `git checkout`,
  `git commit`, `git reset`, `git restore`, etc.).
- **Nothing to review**: if staged mode has no staged files, commit mode has an invalid/unreachable hash, or branch mode has no differences from `main`, report it and stop - do not fall back to an unrelated diff.

## 2. Classify each changed file

For every changed file, decide whether it is **source code** (programming-language files,
scripts, infrastructure-as-code, build/CI configuration with executable logic, SQL migrations,
etc.) or **not source code** (documentation, prose, prompts/instructions, plain data, generic
non-executable configuration, assets, ...). Mixed change sets are normal - classify per file,
not per change set as a whole.

## 3. Review source-code files (code review)

For each source-code file, identify its language/technology (by extension, shebang, or content)
and review it the way that type is best reviewed, e.g.:

- **correctness** - logic errors, edge cases, off-by-one, null/undefined handling, race
  conditions,
- **architecture & design** - separation of concerns, appropriate abstraction level, consistency
  with the existing codebase's patterns and conventions, no unnecessary coupling,
- **language/framework idioms** - does it follow the identified language's/framework's
  established conventions and best practices (e.g. idiomatic error handling in Go,
  PEP 8/typing in Python, correct async/await usage in JS/TS, layer caching and minimal images
  in a Dockerfile, quoting and `set -euo pipefail` in shell scripts, idempotency in IaC,
  parameterized queries in SQL, ...),
- **security** - injection, unsafe deserialization, secrets in code, unsafe permissions, missing
  input validation at trust boundaries,
- **performance** - obvious inefficiencies, unnecessary work in hot paths,
- **error handling & robustness** - swallowed errors, missing cleanup, unclear failure modes,
- **readability & maintainability** - naming, duplication, dead code, overly complex
  constructs,
- **tests** - are the changes covered by tests where the codebase's convention expects it.

Use the codebase's own conventions (linters, style guides, existing patterns,
`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` if present) as the baseline for what "consistent" means in that
project.

## 4. Review non-source-code files (against the original request)

For each non-code file, evaluate the change strictly against the **original request/prompt**
obtained in the Input step:

- **correctness** - does the change do what was asked,
- **completeness** - is anything from the request missing or only partially done,
- **side effects** - did it change something the request did not ask for,
- **consistency** - does it align with related project conventions/instructions where relevant.

## 5. Report remarks

Output **remarks only**, grouped by file (and, for multiple commits, sub-grouped by commit).
For each remark include: the file (and line/section if applicable), a short description of the
issue, and why it matters. If a file/commit has no remarks, say so briefly rather than omitting
it. End with a short overall summary of whether the change set as a whole fulfills the original
request.

Do not invent a severity scale unless the user asks for one; when useful, a simple
Blocking / Minor / Suggestion label per remark is enough.

## Hard Rules

- **Read-only**: never edit, add, remove, stage, unstage, or commit anything - not the reviewed
  files, not any other file.
- Only output findings/remarks as text - no code fixes are applied, even if the fix is obvious.
- Do not skip the Input step - both the change source and the original request must be known
  before reviewing (ask if not already given).
- Never quote secrets found in the diff verbatim in the report
  (`.agents/rules/run.secret-safety.md`) - reference their location instead.
