description: >-
  Remove a previously integrated devcontainer add-on (a template or feature folder from
  https://github.com/RunDevelopmentSk/devcontainers, e.g. `templates/odoo-19`,
  `templates/php-*`, `features/agents`, `features/agents-speckit`,
  `features/agents-superpowers`) from the current project, following the
  `## Removal` instructions in that add-on's `.devcontainer/<add-on>.md` descriptor. Accepts
  the add-on name with or without the `.md` suffix as an argument; if none is given, lists the
  add-ons currently integrated in the project (found via their `.devcontainer/<add-on>.md`
  descriptors) and asks the user to pick one. Builds a concrete removal plan (files/folders to
  delete, appended snippets to strip from scripts/`.gitignore`, symlinks or other Removal-
  section steps to restore) and asks for explicit confirmation before touching anything, since
  deleting untracked files is not reversible. Never commits, stages, or otherwise changes git
  state. Use for "remove add-on", "uninstall devcontainer add-on", "remove
  templates/odoo-19, features/agents, features/agents-speckit,
  features/agents-superpowers, ...", "undo devcontainer feature".

# run-remove-devcontainer-addon

Skill for reversing a devcontainer add-on integration performed via the
`run-integrate-devcontainer-addon` skill (or manually), by following the add-on's own
`## Removal` instructions in `.devcontainer/<add-on>.md`.

## When to use

- "remove add-on", "uninstall devcontainer add-on", "remove `templates/odoo-19`/`features/agents`/`features/agents-speckit`/`features/agents-superpowers`/... from this project", "undo devcontainer feature",
- the entry point is also the command `/run.remove-devcontainer-addon`.

## Input

An add-on name, optionally as an argument to the command/skill:

- accepted forms: `<add-on>` (e.g. `agents-speckit`) or `<add-on>.md` (e.g.
  `agents-speckit.md`) or a path to it (e.g. `.devcontainer/agents-speckit.md`) - normalize by
  stripping any directory prefix and a trailing `.md` suffix to get the bare add-on name,
- **no argument given**: list the add-ons currently integrated in the project - scan
  `.devcontainer/*.md` for descriptors that have a `## Removal` section (plain one-line
  identification stubs like `ubuntu-noble.md` have no such section and are not removable
  add-ons - skip those) - and ask the user to pick one from the list.

## 1. Locate and read the descriptor

Resolve to `.devcontainer/<add-on>.md`. If it does not exist in the project, report that this
add-on is not integrated here and stop - do not guess an alternative.

Read the full file, both the `## Installation` section (it defines what "everything that was
added" in the Removal section actually refers to: which folder was copied in, which snippets
were appended to which files, which `.gitignore` lines were added) and the `## Removal` section
itself (it may add extra steps beyond "delete everything that was added", e.g. restoring a
symlink that installation replaced with a materialized copy).

## 2. Build the removal plan

Determine, as concretely as possible, what this add-on's integration touched:

- **Copied-in files/folders**: to find the exact set, look at project git history for the
  commit(s) that introduced `.devcontainer/<add-on>.md` (e.g.
  `git log --follow --diff-filter=A -- .devcontainer/<add-on>.md`) and inspect that commit's
  file list (`git show --stat <commit>`) as the baseline set of files the add-on added. Files
  from that set that were later merged/reconciled with project-specific content (see the
  `run-integrate-devcontainer-addon` skill) need care in step 3, not blind deletion. If history does
  not clearly show this (e.g. the add-on was integrated without ever being committed), fall back
  to the Installation section's own description of what was copied and ask the user to confirm
  the file list before proceeding.
- **Appended snippets**: the exact snippet text the Installation section says to add to specific
  files (scripts, `.gitignore`, ...) - locate that exact block in the current file content.
- **Removal-section-specific steps**: anything explicitly listed there beyond "delete everything
  that was added" (e.g. `ln -s ...` to restore a symlink, cleaning up now-untracked generated
  files after a `.gitignore` change, ...).

Distinguish, for every file touched by the add-on, whether it is **wholly owned by the add-on**
(safe to delete outright) or **shared with project-specific content** (only the add-on's own
block/snippet should be stripped, the rest of the file must be preserved) - do not delete a
shared file outright just because the add-on touched it.

## 3. Confirm before changing anything

Present the full plan to the user - files/folders to delete, snippets to remove and from which
files, symlinks or other steps to restore - and get explicit confirmation before applying it.
Deleting untracked files is not recoverable via git, so do not skip this step even in an
otherwise autonomous session.

## 4. Apply the plan

On confirmation:

- delete files/folders that are wholly add-on-owned,
- strip the add-on's appended snippet/lines from shared files, leaving the rest of the file
  (including any project-specific content, restored or added there by the
  `run-integrate-devcontainer-addon` skill or manually) untouched,
- perform Removal-section-specific steps (e.g. recreate a symlink),
- leave "rebuild the devcontainer" and other user-side actions for the user - do not attempt to
  run them.

Use plain filesystem operations (delete/edit), not `git rm` - the change should show up as a
normal working-tree diff for the user to review, per the Hard Rules below.

## 5. Summary and open questions

End with: what was deleted, what was stripped from which shared files (and what was left
intact there), which Removal-section steps were performed, any manual follow-up left for the
user (e.g. rebuild the devcontainer), and any spot the skill was not confident about as a direct
question.

## Hard Rules

- **Never commit, stage, unstage, or otherwise change git state** (`git add`, `git commit`,
  `git rm`, `git restore`, `git reset`, ...) - only edit/delete working-tree files; leave
  everything else to the user.
- **Never delete or overwrite anything without the confirmation step (3)** - the removal plan
  must be shown and confirmed first.
- Never delete a file that mixes add-on and project-specific content outright - strip only the
  add-on's own contribution per step 2/4.
- Do not attempt to rebuild the devcontainer or run other environment-changing commands the
  descriptor lists as user steps.
- Never print secret values while reading scripts/config the add-on touches
  (`.agents/rules/run.secret-safety.md`).
